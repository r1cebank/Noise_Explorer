Noisy Depth Image:

Found that when the depth image is really noisy, sharp function will not properly highlight the surface/object

When the noise cancelling is introduced and blur for sharp is turned on, it is solved.


nConsidered:

When the image consists a huge density of just a few depth values, maybe shouldn't set nConsidered that high.

TODO: need to count the depth pixel distribution for proper detection
